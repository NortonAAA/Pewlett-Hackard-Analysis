# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Purpose and Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to idenify the size and impact of the upcomig retirment of staff within the organziation. This includes the areas of focus of roles by department and manager. There is also a provided review of potential mentorship program to share generational work knowledge

## Results of Analysis
### Number of Retiring Employees by Title (How Big is this Wave?)
First deliverable of information from this analysis is to answer the intial question of how large and where:
1) The magnitude of the number of associates is 72,458
2) This represents 24.1% of our total workforce.
3) Based on roles noted in the Figure 1: Number of Employees per Title for Retirement, there are several Senior Level employees that will be vacated
4) Based on mentorship eligibility in Figure 2: Mentorship Eligibility, there are only 1,549 employees to fill that gap from the analysis. Here we have summarized that by role type.

## Summary
In summary, there is going to be a large impact as this wave of associates begin retiring. This is a quarter of the workforce and as this begins, it will have a major impact in middle of the talent heirarchy. So we will have plenty of managers but a lot entry-level workforce. To combat at least a part of this we do have enough to begin to mentor those that are eligible.

As noted in the summary of the mentorship eligibility analysis in our addition of figure 2, there is a good distribution of employees to mentor that are in Senior Staff postions.

A final additional analysis created and show here in Figure 3 is the breakdown of retiring employees by department so we know were to focus on. This should be where we focus the initial groups of mentors
